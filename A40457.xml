            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Anished for Religion, and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to my Prince (in the yeare 1652.) by Cromwelians then bearing ſway, (wee were ſom fifteen of vs ship'tin one bottom) landing in <hi>Britaine</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> I tooke my way to this Province not farre from <hi>Narbon,</hi> where I had frinds having liu'd there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And heer I have been about 24. yeares very ſolitary, ſeeing rarly any of my Countrimen. Thus farre from <hi>Labans</hi> houſe and noys, I finde great tranquility and caſe of minde in Magdalens ſilent contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
            <p>When I have been forced a way, the Land was poſſeſsed by <hi>Philiſtym,</hi> they had the <hi>Arck</hi> captive, and vnder them my country was turned to a <hi>Babylon</hi> of ſinn &amp; vyce: Nothing was to be ſeen in the Streets of this Cittie but oppreſſion of the Iuſt, jniquity, rage, and fury againſt Roman piety; the Altars falne downe, and the Prieſtes bitterly perſecuted, ſome of them conſuming a way in priſons, ſom caſt into exile, and others chaſed in wods and mountains, like wyld beaſts, all of them charged with two great crymes;
<pb facs="tcp:58775:5"/> 
               <hi>To be Catholick Prieſtes, and Loyall to theire king.</hi> All the <hi>Catholicks</hi> true to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Prince,</hi> tranſplanted into a corner of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And this calamity they ſuffered with the reſt, that <hi>Royall authority</hi> was layd a ſid, and a <hi>Dagon</hi> ſett vp <hi>(The tyranny of the vſurping Parlament)</hi> and reverenced.</p>
            <p>This was the face then of that inchanted <hi>Iland:</hi> and they ſay things are noe way amended (as to <hi>Catholick natives)</hi> ſince the kings going home<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that change having noe ways bettered theire fortunes, but that theire calamities and miſeries (ſoe it is written from many hand's) are dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, ſoe as men beaten with <hi>Scourges</hi> in Crumwells tyme, cry out they are now beaten with <hi>Scorpions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Often have I lamented all a lone for my deare Countrys deſolation, and found my greefe inconſolable, becauſe I ſaw noe end of their ſufferings: Somtym it came to my minde, that if a ſincere relation of our hard ſervitude and extremities were given to <hi>Catholick Princes</hi> with humble prayers, this would doe vs good; but a gaine when I called to minde that this had been don allready, and that able and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonages had ſaid theſe things in
<pb facs="tcp:58775:5"/> ſignificant language, and that they had in all Courts but cold and delaying anſwers, I diſpair'd of all releefe that way. One of our Bishops having been in <hi>Rome</hi> Anno 1652. <hi>Ad viſitanda limina Apoſtolica,</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence with the then <hi>Cardinal Secretary</hi> (after <hi>Alexander Septimus)</hi> his <hi>Eminency</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> it was a ſenſible greefe to his Holyneſſe to ſee his Children of <hi>Irland</hi> a conſtant people in Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſoe ſorly afflicted, and caſt downe, and holy faith allmoſt extinguished, and that there was noe way poſſible to releeve them; the <hi>Prelate</hi> reply'd our wound is now indeed ſoe wide and feaſtered, as is very hard to heal it, but when it was fresh, not ſoe wide, and as yet curable, our Nation found no <hi>Samaritan</hi> that would power oyle and wine into it.</p>
            <p>One thing I shall ſay; worthy to be written in Characters of gold, that a <hi>Catholick Prince</hi> driven out of his owne Dominions, was hee that offered faireſt <hi>Ad rem Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licorum in Hibernia reſtituendam; Charles P.

            <p>I know my owne weakneſs, and the
<pb facs="tcp:58775:11"/> flowneſs of my tallent, but I had tyme at will for helping this; the ſncile coms to the topp of the hill in her due tyme, as well as the Eagle, and with tyme and ſtraw (as they vſe to ſpeake) men ripen medlers, and ſoe doe men theire affaires with leaſure and meanes, and who will doe a thing well, muſt have patience to tarry till it may be well don; I had patience and leaſure enough, and at length I have brought my deſigne to an end, whether it be well don or noe, I leave to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the impartiall reader. I gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what was don to a <hi>Doctor of devinity,</hi> a perſon of Emminent Learning, and to other frinds in <hi>Paris,</hi> they vrg'd mee with ſtronge lynes, to print all was don without delay: I alſoe writt to a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Prelate then living in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whoſe judgment I much eſteemed, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Amity between vs of a bove 45. yeares; hee quite beyond my expectation diſſwaded the printing, and gave reaſons that ſeemed ſound, hee would not blame thoſe preſſed mee to the printing, nor judge ill of theire intentions, but was of opinion, they had not rightly conſidered the more ſubſtantiall circumſtances of the
<pb facs="tcp:58775:11"/> matter, and ſayd, deare frind my advice in this point is. <hi>Feſtina Lente,</hi> hee ſuggeſted that regard should be had of <hi>Ormonas</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Catholick Anceſtors,</hi> and ſpecially of his Grand-father <hi>Walter Earle</hi> of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and of his owne pious parents, and of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mr. Richard Butler</hi> a Chavaliere of great devotion, and yet valliant in the face of his Enemy, and of his ſiſters, all of them vertuous <hi>Catholick</hi> Ladys; hee knew them all, and was well knowne to ſome of them: certainly I did not think this very reuerend church-man had been ſoe kinde to <hi>Ormond,</hi> his letter hee ended with theſe lynes.</p>
            <p>My worthy frind, I beſeech you bee as kinde to <hi>Ormond,</hi> as the overſeer of the vyn-yard was to the figgtree in his charge, who, (when the Lord of the vyn-yard fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding noe fruict in the tree as hee expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſayd in anger <hi>Succide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I yielded to this venerable perſons Iudgment, and ſuſpended the printing from the yeare 1668. to this 1676.

            <p>WEe are in this place to ſee what the Congregation did, with their divins. After making a ſound ponderation vpon the above foure Propoſitions, and other Acts and Ordinances of the ſeveral aſſemblys of that Kingdom, they came to a mature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the 30. Articles, above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and for their ſurer conduct and better vnderſtanding of all, made vſe of the adviſe and counſell of the two eminenteſt, and famous lawyers of the land, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de certaine ſound obſervations vpon that peace and conceſſions of <hi>Glanmorgan,</hi> the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58775:34"/> ſubſtance of thoſe obſervations is digeſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four Articles</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Committie of treaty waved the the benefit of <hi>Glanmorgan's</hi> conceſſions, by not onely not inſiſting vpon them, but not ſoe much as propoſing them, during the treaty with my lord Leutenant, which was contrarie to the truſt and charge laid vpon them by the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A publick faith given by the Kingdom to the lord <hi>Nuntio</hi> and Cleargy to make <hi>Glanmorgan's</hi> conceſſions, and all conditions for Churches and Religion, as publick, as valid, and of as much force as that of the temporal, was not performed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the king did diſavow <hi>Glanmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan's</hi> conceſſions, ſoe as they became vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly therby void, for which reaſons the Cleargy were to provide for themſelves by other wayes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Vpon the percloſing of thoſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ſaid lawyers hath this enſueing language. If the caſe of reference <hi>to further conceſſions,</hi> granted in the agreement of ſaid 30. Articles can not extend to what the lord Leutenant publickly diſauoued, and as wee vnderſtand (on the very perfection of ſaid 30. Arucles) he before witneſſes, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58775:34"/> to witt that the ſaid clauſe <hi>of further conceſſions</hi> in his peace was not meant by him to extend to <hi>Glanmorgan's</hi> conceſſions, shall then the ſecuritie of Religion and Churches in all the Kingdom depend on a matter that hath ſoe many doubts in it?</p>
            <p>Beſides if thoſe 30. Articles concluded with <hi>Ormond</hi> had any matter of moment in them for Religion, before perfection of them, the King reuoked the lord Leutenant's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and by this all goes to ground, for without authoritie he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect articles. This revocation is in print and expreſſed in a letter from his Majeſtie to the Marquez of <hi>Ormond the</hi> 11. 1646. as followeth.</p>

            <p>By what is ſaid you ſee <hi>Ormonds</hi> commiſſion was reuoked before perfecting the ſaid pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of 30. Articles (which shall be more expreſsly made cleare hereafter) and did not his Excellencie knowing this, play foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the confederat catholicks? what then did he intend by intruding this peace vpon us? what other but to cheat and deceave us by getting from us vpon conſiderat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n of ſuch a peace (as in effect he did) all our forts, citties, townes, armes, armies, and nauy vnder his owne command, and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing our aſſociation and gouvemement; was not this a handſom tricke and plott for vndoeing vs taking away all our defenſe for noe other conſideration then that of thoſe plaiſtred articles perfected without any commiſſion, that could and lightly would be diſavoued in Parlament by his Majeſtie, as concluded without his authoritie, and conſequently wee ſhould gaine noe grace nor
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58775:36"/> pardon by them.</p>
            <p>After the Biſhops and other ordinaries, and diuins, had well conſidered theſe things, and more particularly the reſult of the two renowned lawyers, who were eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial leading-men in the common-wealth; after long debate, and learned arguments, great diligence, ſearch and paines, they found it evident, that Religion, eſtates, lives, liberties, and ſaftie of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, lay open to danger, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the 30. articles agreed vpon with <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> by the commitie of treaty (who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging not the truſt laid vpon them by failing to purſue the inſtructions giuen them, as aboue was ſaid) and finding all the citties, townes, forts Garriſons, armie ſhips, magazins., and the ſtrenght of the Catholicks to be rendred vp to the lord Leutenant (as ſome of them already was) and the ſupreame Councel had by that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eded their authoritie, and ſubmitted to the ſaid peace, which had been (as was ſaid) proclaimed and published ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nly by the Kings-at-armes in <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Kilkennie,</hi> and that the lord Leutenant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me from <hi>Dublin</hi> gallantly attended by many hundreds of prime Gentlemen, was then at

               <hi>Kelkenny</hi> and began to gouverne acccor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the articles of the peace; the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops (I ſay) and Cleargy naked and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout any garde other then the protection of God, and affection of good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, after invoking the name of the moſt high, came to a final reſult, which was the inſueing decree, which they put foorth, and cauſed to be publiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hed to the Catholicks over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58775:40"/> in ſaid letter were expedients offered by the Congregation for ſecuring the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, liues liberties and eſtates of the Catholicks.</p>
            <p>One (and that a principal propoſition) that <hi>Glanmorgans</hi> conceſſions vpon which the comitie of Treaty relyed as to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) should be made as valid and pudlick as the 30. articles, and of the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce with them for the benefit and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Catholicks. <hi>Ormond,</hi> (who was then in <hi>Kelkennie</hi> when the mentioned let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was receaued by the ſupreme Councel) anſwered he had noe power to conſent to ſuch conſeſſions, nor as much as to add any article to the 30. articles, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (by vertue of which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded ſaid 30. articles with them) being expired, yet he promiſed all the frindly offices that lay in his power, and all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation with the king for the ſatisfaction of the Catholicks, which was noe ſecuritie nor ſatisfaction to the Catholick Prelats.</p>
            <p>The ſupreme Councel, after receauing the mentioned declaration and propoſitions, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Sr. <hi>Lucas Dillon</hi> knight and <hi>Gerrat Finnel</hi> Eſquire (both of the Councel) with <hi>Thomas Tirel</hi> and <hi>Laurence Dudal</hi> eſquires, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               </hi> in that affaire) after all was heard and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of, and all they ſaid repreſented to the Congregation, there was nothing of ſecuritie found as to Religion and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>Heere it is to be particularly obſerved, that the Lord Leutenant <hi>Ormond</hi> vpon a ſudden departed from <hi>Kelkennie</hi> to <hi>Dublin</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a man poſſeſſed by ſome feare, when Sir <hi>Luke</hi> and the reſt were vpon their way to <hi>VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford,</hi> which departure of his preſcinded all expectation of giving ſuch ſecuritie and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as the Biſhops and Cleargy exſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Heer vpon the Congregation tould Sir <hi>Lucas</hi> and the reſt of the Gentlemen, there was noe other way remaining for ſatisfying all good men, then to ſummon of new a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58775:41"/> Aſſembly of the confederat Catholicks, and there and then to have the 30. Articles of 46. more nicely examened, and by them to be recepted, or rejected as pleaſed the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the whole Catholick Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>This is a candid and ample accoumpt I give you out of the mentioned divin of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and procedings of the Biſhops and Cleargy aſſembled in <hi>VVaterford,</hi> to the end (that all their tranſactions there and then rightly pondered and vnderſtood) they may appeare to the world (as really they are) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and blameleſſe as acting nothing therin, but what the dictamen of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience led them vnto, touching the 30. Articles.</p>
            <p>It is by this manifeſtly known how <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> mercenarie pens, and others vpon their ſuggeſtions (without any ſearch or examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) haue both bitterly ſpoken and written of theſe Biſhops, and of all the cleargy for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſide that peace; one of which (and that wrote bitterly) was <hi>F. Peeter VVailſh,</hi> who cenſured them griuouſly for ſoe doeing, thought at the ſame time, this Congregation ſate, this friar was as much againſt the ſaid 30. Articles and <hi>Ormond,</hi> as another; how he came to Change his mind, and writ for <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:58775:42"/> againſt the Bishops and Cleargy, I know not, neither to this day hath he given any ground or reaſon, nor is able to doe, for that his inſtabilitie; and if in caſe he had apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, yet noe regard ought to be had by any good and Zealous Catholick, of what he ſayes, in as much as he lyes vnder the curſe of an excommunication major (as I haue ſaid in the Preface) prononced againſt him by a general Chapter of his owne order, againſt whom he moſt rebelliouſly ſtands out refuſing ſubmiſſion to them.</p>
            <p>I hope theſe things well conſidered the Bishops and Cleargy aſſembled in <hi>VVaterford</hi> will looſe noe eſteme in the ſight of good impartial Chriſtians, but rather be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for their zeale vnd fortitude in Gods cauſe; wee are not to feare fire nor ſword, nor the graetneſs of men, when wee ſpeake for God and his glorie. <hi>Loquebar</hi> (ſaith the divin pſalmiſt) <hi>de teſtimonijs tuis in conſpectu re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum &amp; non confundebar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The diuin by me aboue cited proteſted before God and his Angels, that the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops and cleargy had noe intention to offend <hi>Ormond</hi> in that proceeding, or to blemish his honnor in the leaſt, but they were much vnſatisfied with the Comitie of Treaty, for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58775:42"/> neglecting and not performing the truſt laid vnto their charge; by which proteſtation you ſee the Bishops gave noe cauſe to <hi>Ormond</hi> to depart <hi>Kelkennie</hi> for <hi>Dublin,</hi> nor as much as thought of his goeing, or ſuſpected in the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt that he would be gon, but his owne conſcience why ſpered various thoughts vnto him: ſoe that <hi>verè trepidabat timore vbi non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat timor.</hi> He trembled with feare where the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re was noe occaſion of feare: howeuer ſince this great man departed for <hi>Dublin,</hi> he foſtered an inveterat <hi>odium</hi> againſt the Biſhops and Cleargy ſwearing and proteſting he will be avenged of that <hi>ſtinking creuw</hi> (ſoe he is heard to call them); which vnuſuall forme of ſpeech to an intire, and of an intire body of Biſhops, vertuous, learned, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men, (divers of them being noblie deſcended.)

               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:58775:43"/> 
               <hi>gave a ſcandal which aſperſed them, and aſperſed not them, and the whole Iriſh Cleargy alone, but euen their Communion and Religion in its total extent, ſpecially through theſe Nations.</hi> Further he ſayes, <hi>they rendred the Catholicks vncapable of any mercy intended by the King for tender conſciences; that great argument being (ſaith he) the Iriſh rebellion in 41, the oppoſition and reiection of the peace of 46. with all the circumſtances and conſequents of euer ſince the fatall worke of</hi> Waterford <hi>Congregation: the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition likewiſe made by a very conſiderable part of the Cleargy and people to the peace of 48, and the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argy's rendring it at laſt fruitleſs (euen I ſay after a general reception of, and ſubmiſſion to it) by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration made, and cenſure iſſued at</hi> lameſtowne, <hi>and by the indeuours before and afther that laſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat meeting of the Bishops; finally their twice forcing, or at leaſt putting a neceſſitie on his Majeſties Leutenant to depart the Kingdom.</hi>

            <p>Could the <hi>Kings</hi> intention of the benefitt of pardon and his mercy to the <hi>Irish Catholicks</hi> be ſpooken in more cleare and noble expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?
